# Outline what else needs to be done if given more time

<!--
-- if more time was given would have created a separate style system with All brand guidelines declarion and utilities classes taking reusibility into accounts

-- Would have created more components to make the code more clean and readable
-- Would have implemented Field validations with error message and colors
-- Would have implemented Button with Gradients with Separated Button Component
