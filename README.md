# WIN Front End Engineering Interview



# My Assumptions

1. I installed npm as the start
2. Axiforma font was not available for free over internet, so I used Open Sans instead
3. I have created two components named "ContactUsTop" and "ContactUsTop" in components folder
4. For mobile view there was no figma , so assumed its design
5. Also I have attached screenshots for both Desktop view and Mobile View. 
6. Applied some basic inline HTML validations to the field




# What else we can do

1. It can be designed for tablet view as well which comes in between Mobile and Desktop both
2. We can apply more validations to the fields.
3. We can create Backend using Nodejs and MongoDB for Database.
4. We can have header and footer for the page as well.
5. We can give some hover effects to the buttons so that it can be felt user friendly
