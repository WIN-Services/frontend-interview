# WIN Front End Assessment ~ Suryansh Anand

## Features 
✅ mobile responsive\
✅ basic form validation\
✅ animation on buttons

## Assumptions

- I could not get "**axiforma**" from Google fonts or other sources, so I used "Lato" as
  the font-family.
- I have assumed h1 to be 36px, h2 to be 18px and normal font size to be 15px. These
  values have been taken from the design prototype.
- Similarly, for buttons the padding has been taken from the design prototype.
- Given more time I would like to:
    - I would also like to validate the form in a much stricter and controlled
      manner.
    - Handle each input field in state and control them for a much better
      error handling. Handle focussed, blur and change of each input field.
    - add a hCaptcha field to protect from bots.
    - Refactor the code to make components such as the button much more reusable.
    - explore animation options for the form and page.
    - add form submission (simulation) and validation for newsletter subscription.
