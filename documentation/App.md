# Form Page

## **`Assumptions made`**
```
Sanserif font can be used instead of Axiforma, since its not available in google Fonts anymore.
```
---
## **`Actions that can be completed if provided extra time`**


```
Making the form responsive to fit mobile needs using @media Queries and @container Queries.

Usage of Autofill of locations using the library react-places-complete.

Addition of Hover effects and handling active state and focused state of inputs.

Validation for input fields.
```

## **`Suggestions`**

```
React Hook Forms library can be used for better form validations.

Tailwind CSS more developer friendly than Material UI. Easier to handle custom CSS styles.
